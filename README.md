# XLSX, CSV, TSV & Markdown Editor - VS Code Extension

This is an open-source project that allows you to view and edit XLSX files with styles, fonts, and colors from Excel files, supporting multiple sheets. Additionally, it provides a table view and editing capabilities for CSV, TSV, and Github Flavored Markdown (.md) files directly in VS Code.

## 📌 Overview

XLSX, CSV, TSV & Markdown Editor is a powerful **Visual Studio Code** extension that allows users to **open, view, and edit Excel files (.xlsx)**, **CSV**, **TSV**, and **Markdown (.md) files directly within VS Code**. It provides a seamless, lightweight experience without requiring external software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

**🚨 Important Note**: This extension was previously named **`XLSX Viewer & CSV Editor`**. It has since been renamed to **`XLSX, CSV, TSV & Markdown Editor`** to reflect added support for TSV and Markdown (.md) files.

## 🚀 Features

### XLSX Viewing
✅ **Fast & Lightweight** - View Excel spreadsheets quickly within VS Code\
✅ **Retains Formatting** - Keeps cell styles, colors, and text formatting\
✅ **Multiple Sheet Support** - View all sheets in your Excel workbook\
✅ **Toggle Background Mode** - Easily switch between Light, Dark, and **VS Code** (mirrors editor theme) backgrounds\
✅ **Persistent Theme** - Remembers your last used theme across files and sessions\
✅ **Interactive Table View** - Display spreadsheet data in a structured HTML table\
✅ **Color Detection & Conversion** - Converts ARGB Excel colors into CSS-compatible formats\
✅ **Plain View Mode** - Strip all Excel styling to view data like CSV/TSV for cleaner inspection

### XLSX Editing
✅ **In-Table Editing** - Edit XLSX sheets directly in the webview table with **Edit**, **Save**, and **Cancel** actions.
✅ **Undo/Redo & Shortcuts** - Support for <kbd>Ctrl+Z</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl+Y</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> to save, and <kbd>Enter</kbd> to navigate cells while editing.
✅ **Toolbar & Settings Panel** - Toolbar and settings (sticky toolbar, header options, hyperlink preview, toggle header) are available in the XLSX view for quick access and parity with the CSV editor.
✅ **How it works** - Changes are made in the webview and persisted back to the original `.xlsx` file when you click **Save**. The extension uses ExcelJS to write workbook changes while attempting to preserve styles and formatting where possible. **Cancel** discards any unsaved changes.

### Settings for XLSX Editing
- `xlsxViewer.xlsx.firstRowIsHeader` — Treat the first row as a header (renders bold).
- `xlsxViewer.xlsx.stickyHeader` — Make the header row sticky when enabled.
- `xlsxViewer.xlsx.stickyToolbar` — Keep the workbook toolbar fixed at the top of the editor.
- `xlsxViewer.xlsx.hyperlinkPreview` — Show hover previews for hyperlinks with Open/Copy actions.

> ⚠️ Notes & Limitations: Formulas are not automatically recalculated by the webview; very large workbooks or complex charts may be slow to edit. The editor aims to preserve styles and merged-cell behavior where possible.


### 🆕 Merged Cells & Resizing Support
✅ **Merged Cell Support** - Full support for both horizontal and vertical merged cells from Excel files, with proper content alignment and original Excel formatting\
✅ **Interactive Resizing** - Drag column/row borders to resize, with visual resize handles, hover effects, and real-time size indicators\
✅ **Auto-Fit Functionality** - Auto-fit button and double-click to auto-fit columns/rows based on content, with smart content-based sizing and width limits

### 🆕 Excel-like Multi-Selection & Copy
✅ **Multi-Selection for Rows/Columns** - Hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> to select/deselect multiple rows or columns, <kbd>Shift</kbd> to select a range\
✅ **Excel/Google Sheets Compatible Copy** - Copying and pasting preserves cell structure in Excel/Google Sheets\
✅ **Improved Selection Management** - Visual feedback for multi-row/column selection and selection size info box in the bottom right corner.

### CSV & TSV Editing
✅ **Table View** - View CSV and TSV files in a structured table format\
✅ **Virtualized Rendering for Large Files** - Virtualization (windowed rendering) improves performance and reduces memory usage by rendering only visible rows for both CSV and TSV files\
✅ **Edit Table Mode** - Edit directly in the table with **Save**, **Cancel**, and **Undo/Redo** support\
✅ **Excel-like Shortcuts** - <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> to save, <kbd>Enter</kbd> to move down, <kbd>Ctrl+Z/Y</kbd> for undo/redo\
✅ **Premium UI** - Smooth animations, sticky headers, and Apple-like visual feedback\
✅ **Edit File** - Open the CSV/TSV in VS Code’s default text editor when needed\
✅ **File Conversion** - Convert between CSV, TSV, and XLSX from the in-view toolbar (and command palette) while editing/viewing supported files (multi-sheet XLSX exports to CSV/TSV use the first worksheet)\

**TSV notes:** Copying from the table and pasting into other apps will use tab-delimited data for TSV files; serialization and escaping behave like CSV but use `\t` as the delimiter for TSV.

### Markdown Viewer & Editor
✅ **Preview & Edit Modes** - Toggle between a rendered Markdown preview and an inline editor with **Edit Preview**, **Save**, and **Cancel**.
✅ **Toolbar & Settings** - Word Wrap, Line Numbers, Sticky Toolbar and theme toggle available in the editor toolbar.
✅ **Local Rendering** - Fast, lightweight rendering for common Markdown syntax (headers, lists, code blocks, tables, task lists, images, links). **Uses GitHub-Flavored Markdown (GFM) for rendering (tables, task lists, fenced code blocks, etc.).**
✅ **Theme Support** - Respects Light / Dark / VS Code theme using the shared `ThemeManager`.
✅ **Open with Preview** - Open `.md` files with the extension via the editor toolbar or the command palette.
